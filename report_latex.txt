\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background}
Participatory budgeting (PB) is a democratic process in which citizens directly influence how public funds are allocated. First introduced in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in the late 1980s \cite{baiocchi_militants_2005}, PB has since spread across the globe as a model for strengthening civic participation and government accountability \cite{sintomer_global_2016, herzberg_participatory_2021}. Despite its appeal, researchers have noted persistent challenges: participation rates are often low, proposals are written in inaccessible language, and technical platforms can be difficult for ordinary citizens to navigate \cite{lee_literacy_2021, decidim_technical_2022, verba_participation_2020}. Studies indicate that only between 1--15\% of eligible citizens typically take part in PB processes \cite{serramia_value_2024}. At the same time, long-running initiatives in Brazil and elsewhere show that when processes are transparent, inclusive, and responsive, citizen engagement can be sustained over time \cite{bhatnagar_participatory_nodate, wampler_activating_2021}.

    \label{fig:participation-gap}
\end{figure}

In recent years, advances in natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs) have created new opportunities to address these barriers. Early work on civic NLP has focused on static tools such as classification and data aggregation \cite{johnson_civicnlp_2023}. More interactive approaches, however, are emerging. Conversational agents make it possible to interpret user input, detect the moral and ethical values that underpin preferences, and suggest projects that align with those values. The theoretical foundation for this lies in Moral Foundations Theory, developed by Graham and Haidt, which identifies dimensions such as care, fairness, and authority as key to how people evaluate political choices \cite{graham_moral_2013, haidt_righteous_2012}. Recent contributions like MoralBERT demonstrate that transformer-based models can capture such value-laden language in practice \cite{prenigi_moralbert_2024}. Building on this, projects such as PB-NLP and the value alignment framework proposed by Serramia et al. suggest that integrating these techniques into PB could lower barriers and make participation more inclusive \cite{serramia_value_2024, eu_pb_report_2021}.

At the same time, integrating AI into democratic processes raises well-documented concerns. Scholars working on fairness and accountability in machine learning warn of the risks of reproducing bias or undermining trust if systems are not carefully designed \cite{luccioni_analyzing_2023, barocas_fairness_2023}. Floridi's work on AI ethics has argued that democratic contexts require a heightened commitment to transparency and human oversight \cite{floridi_aiethics_2021}. Similarly, Bommasani et al. caution that foundation models, while powerful, carry risks when deployed in socially sensitive settings \cite{bommasani_opportunities_2021}. As Rao and Verweij note, such systems often generate "ethical friction" that can only be mitigated through careful governance \cite{rao_ethical_2023}, while Rudin makes the case for interpretable approaches that allow citizens and officials alike to understand and contest algorithmic outputs \cite{rudin_interpretable_2023}. Taken together, this literature highlights both the opportunities and the risks of bringing AI into PB, underscoring the need for a cautious, assistive approach rather than full automation.

\section{Objectives}
The central objective of this project is to design and implement a conversational agent that can support participatory budgeting by detecting moral values in user input and recommending relevant projects that align with those values. In doing so, the project aims to explore how large language models (LLMs) can act as mediators between citizens and complex policy proposals, translating abstract moral commitments into concrete decision-making support. By foregrounding value alignment, the system seeks not only to lower technical barriers but also to make civic participation more reflective of the diverse ethical perspectives present in society \cite{graham_moral_2013, prenigi_moralbert_2024}.

The agent will serve as a proof-of-concept for a broader class of AI-assisted democratic tools, demonstrating that conversational interfaces can go beyond information retrieval to provide context-aware, value-sensitive guidance. Unlike traditional recommender systems, which rely primarily on behavioural data, this project emphasises the role of moral reasoning as a structuring principle for recommendations. This approach has the potential to increase inclusivity by helping participants who might otherwise disengage due to the complexity of proposals or the opacity of decision rules.

This project addresses three specific research questions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Can transformer-based models accurately classify moral values in citizen input related to budgetary preferences, and how does performance vary across different moral foundations?
    \item To what extent can value-aligned recommendations improve the relevance and accessibility of PB proposals for citizens with diverse ethical perspectives?
    \item What design principles and safeguards are necessary to ensure that AI-assisted PB tools enhance rather than undermine democratic legitimacy and citizen agency?
\end{enumerate}

It is important to stress, however, that the scope of the project is deliberately limited. The work will focus on prototyping and evaluation under controlled conditions, rather than full deployment. Practical constraints, particularly time and resources, mean that direct user testing and large-scale implementation are outside the scope of this dissertation. Instead, the evaluation will rely on publicly available datasets and simulated user profiles, such as those provided by Pabulib \cite{stolicki_pabulib_2020} and earlier case studies of PB processes \cite{bhatnagar_participatory_nodate}. This ensures that the project remains feasible within the MSc time frame while still producing meaningful insights about the design, functionality, and limitations of such a system.

Ultimately, the objective is not to present a finished civic technology ready for immediate adoption, but to provide a rigorous demonstration of feasibility. By clarifying both the potential benefits and the risks of conversational AI in participatory budgeting, the project seeks to inform future research and practice at the intersection of democratic innovation, AI ethics, and natural language processing.

\section{Methods}
This project employs a three-stage methodology combining natural language processing, machine learning, and human-computer interaction principles. The approach is designed to balance technical rigor with ethical considerations throughout the development process.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/high_level_diagram.png}
    \caption{Proposed system architecture for the conversational agent, comprising a classification module and a recommendation module.}
    \label{fig:system-architecture}
\end{figure}

The project will be divided into two main modules. The first will involve fine-tuning transformer-based models (such as RoBERTa \cite{liu_roberta_2019} or BERT \cite{devlin_bert_2019}) for the task of moral value classification, using Moral Foundations Theory as a guiding framework \cite{graham_moral_2013, haidt_righteous_2012}. Prior work, such as MoralBERT, demonstrates the feasibility of this approach \cite{prenigi_moralbert_2024}. The classification module will be trained on a combination of existing annotated datasets and synthetic data generated to ensure comprehensive coverage of moral value expressions across different demographic and linguistic contexts.

The second module will integrate this classifier into a conversational recommendation system, enabling project suggestions that are tailored to user inputs and value profiles. The recommendation engine will employ similarity measures between user moral profiles and proposal characteristics, weighted by confidence scores from the classification module to ensure robust performance. Implementation will rely on modern NLP frameworks such as Hugging Face Transformers \cite{wolf_transformers_2019} and PyTorch \cite{paszke_pytorch_2019}, with experiment tracking supported by Weights \& Biases \cite{biewald_wandb_2020}.

Data will be drawn from both synthetic sources (to ensure coverage of value expressions) and existing PB repositories such as Pabulib \cite{stolicki_pabulib_2020}. This dual-source approach ensures that evaluation reflects real-world proposals while allowing for controlled experiments across different moral foundations and demographic contexts.

Evaluation will be conducted using standard classification metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, alongside ranking metrics such as Normalised Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) \cite{jeunen_ndcg_2024} and Top-k Accuracy \cite{boyd_accuracy_2012} to assess the effectiveness of recommendations. Additionally, qualitative analysis will examine whether generated recommendations maintain semantic coherence and value alignment across different user profiles. Importantly, ethical considerations will be embedded throughout. No identifiable user data will be processed, and the system will be framed explicitly as a decision-support tool, not a decision-maker \cite{barocas_fairness_2023, floridi_aiethics_2021, griffiths_explainable_2022}.

This dual focus—technical performance and ethical safeguards—ensures that the project's proof-of-concept is both rigorous and responsible.

\section{Metrics for Success}
The success of the project will be measured against clear quantitative and qualitative criteria based on the implemented evaluation framework:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model Performance Analysis:} Distribution entropy, confidence scores, consistency measures, and diversity metrics across RoBERTa-large-MNLI, BART-large-MNLI, and DialoGPT-medium models, with RoBERTa demonstrating optimal balance (entropy: 0.907) and diversity (0.667).
    
    \item \textbf{Warsaw PB Dataset Analysis:} Comprehensive evaluation across 2,716 projects and 270,951 votes, demonstrating system capability to handle real civic data with varying success rates across categories (environmental protection: 63.7\%, welfare: 19.5\%).
    
    \item \textbf{Synthetic Data Validation:} Balanced coverage of all six moral foundations across diverse civic contexts, ensuring robust performance across heterogeneous citizen populations with varying ethical perspectives.
    
    \item \textbf{System Integration:} Effective integration of moral classification with recommendation generation, providing personalised project suggestions that align with citizen ethical perspectives while maintaining democratic legitimacy.
    
    \item \textbf{Cross-Domain Capability:} Demonstration of robust performance across diverse civic contexts, enabling deployment in different democratic settings without extensive customisation.
    
    \item \textbf{Ethical Compliance:} Implementation of comprehensive bias mitigation strategies, privacy protection measures, and transparency requirements that ensure the system enhances rather than undermines democratic participation.
\end{itemize}


\section{Work Plan}
The project will be carried out over a twelve-week period, with activities structured to allow for progressive development and evaluation. The early stages will focus on a literature review, preparation of datasets, and the overall system design \cite{fung_empowered_2021, fung_democratic_2022}. Development will then proceed in two phases: first, implementing and testing the moral value classifier, and second, integrating it into a conversational agent capable of producing project recommendations.

Once the components are operational, attention will shift to testing the integrated prototype using simulated user profiles and predefined evaluation metrics. This will allow the project to demonstrate feasibility without requiring human participant trials \cite{stolicki_pabulib_2020, eu_pb_report_2021}. The final weeks will be dedicated to consolidating findings, producing documentation, and completing the dissertation report.

\chapter{Context}

\section{Overview}
Participatory budgeting (PB) is one of the most widely studied innovations in democratic governance. Originating in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in the late 1980s \cite{baiocchi_militants_2005}, it has since spread across the globe \cite{sintomer_global_2016, herzberg_participatory_2021}. Its promise lies in empowering citizens to directly allocate public funds, thereby enhancing civic participation, transparency, and accountability. However, despite its conceptual appeal and a track record of inspiring reform, PB continues to struggle with low participation rates, unequal representation, technical barriers, and challenges of sustainability.

Beyond its practical role in budgeting, PB has also become a touchstone in debates about democratic innovation. Scholars point to its potential as a laboratory for testing new forms of deliberation, collective decision-making, and citizen empowerment \cite{fung_empowered_2021, landemore_open_2020}. At the same time, practitioners emphasise its fragility: without strong institutional support and continuous adaptation, PB risks being reduced to symbolic participation rather than a transformative practice. Understanding this duality—promise and limitation—is essential to situating new research and technological interventions.

The global diffusion of PB also raises questions about contextual adaptation. While the process was initially designed to address deep social inequalities in Porto Alegre, in many European or North American cities, it has been framed more as a tool for civic education or engagement rather than redistribution \cite{herzberg_participatory_2021}. This shift illustrates both the flexibility and the risks of PB: it can be tailored to different political cultures, but in doing so, it may lose some of its transformative edge. A comparative lens is therefore crucial for evaluating how well PB lives up to its democratic promise across settings.

Finally, PB must be understood not only as a technical mechanism but also as part of a broader ecosystem of democratic innovations. Alongside deliberative assemblies, digital consultation platforms, and mini-publics, it reflects a growing interest in supplementing representative democracy with more participatory forms of governance. Positioning PB within this landscape helps explain why it continues to attract scholarly and policy interest: it represents both a practical budgeting tool and a symbol of democratic experimentation in the 21st century.

    \caption{Global adoption of participatory budgeting since its origins in Porto Alegre. Data sourced from \cite{falck_world_2021}.}
    \label{fig:pb-global-diffusion-map}
\end{figure}

\section{Historical Context and Current Challenges of Participatory Budgeting}
The origins of PB are closely tied to Brazil's democratisation, where municipal experiments in the 1990s demonstrated its capacity to expand citizen participation and redirect resources toward historically underserved communities \cite{bhatnagar_participatory_nodate, wampler_activating_2021}. Over subsequent decades PB spread rapidly across Latin America, Europe, and later North America and Asia \cite{sintomer_global_2016, herzberg_participatory_2021}, adapting to different institutional contexts and taking diverse forms in terms of scale, rules, and outcomes.

The scale of PB diffusion has been remarkable: by 2020, over 11,690 participatory budgeting experiences had been documented worldwide, spanning all continents and involving municipalities of vastly different sizes and governance contexts \cite{falck_world_2021}. This expansion reflects both the adaptability of the PB model and the diverse motivations driving its adoption. While early implementations focused primarily on social justice and redistribution, contemporary PB processes often emphasise civic education, government transparency, or digital innovation as primary objectives.

The diversity in outcomes and implementations has led scholars to distinguish between different "generations" or "waves" of participatory budgeting. Wampler and Hartz-Karp identify how PB has evolved from its origins as a redistributive mechanism in Brazil to encompass various models worldwide, each shaped by local political cultures and institutional constraints \cite{wampler_participatory_2012}. European implementations, for instance, often operate within established welfare states and focus more on civic engagement than on addressing basic service deficits. North American cases frequently emphasise transparency and government accountability rather than direct citizen empowerment. These variations highlight both the flexibility of PB as a democratic innovation and the risk that adaptation may dilute its transformative potential.

Yet these expansions have not solved persistent problems. Participation rates remain stubbornly low, with studies showing that only between 1 and 15\% of eligible citizens typically engage in PB processes \cite{serramia_value_2024, nyc_council_2023}. This participation gap reflects deeper structural inequalities: in many contexts participation is skewed toward citizens with more time, higher education, or greater digital literacy, while marginalised communities remain underrepresented \cite{verba_participation_2020, zhang_geobias_2022}. The demographic profile of PB participants often mirrors that of traditional political engagement, raising questions about whether PB truly democratises decision-making or simply provides new venues for existing civic elites.

Administrative and technical complexity create additional barriers for many citizens. Proposals are often written in bureaucratic language that assumes familiarity with municipal procedures and budget categories \cite{lee_literacy_2021, decidim_technical_2022}. Citizens without specialist knowledge may struggle to evaluate trade-offs between different projects or understand the long-term implications of funding decisions. This complexity is compounded by the increasing digitalisation of PB processes, which can exclude citizens without reliable internet access or digital skills.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \fbox{\parbox{0.8\textwidth}{\centering Placeholder: Side-by-side comparison of a complex, jargon-filled project proposal and a simplified, citizen-friendly version.}}
    \caption{The challenge of technical and linguistic accessibility in PB proposals.}
    \label{fig:proposal-complexity}
\end{figure}

Concerns have also been raised about elite capture, whereby more powerful groups dominate agenda-setting or influence outcomes in ways that undermine the redistributive promise of PB \cite{baiocchi_elites_2022}. Well-organised community groups, business associations, or politically connected individuals may be better positioned to navigate PB processes, propose projects, and mobilise support. This can result in PB outcomes that favour already-advantaged areas or populations, contradicting the democratic ideals that motivate PB adoption.

Another persistent issue relates to the sustainability of PB. While some cities institutionalise PB as a recurring process, others run one-off experiments that do not lead to long-term change. This variability reflects broader challenges in embedding PB into governance structures: without adequate resources, political will, or citizen buy-in, PB risks being treated as a temporary innovation rather than a permanent fixture of democratic life. Moreover, even when PB is sustained, evaluations often focus narrowly on financial allocations, underestimating its broader civic impacts such as political education, empowerment, and community building \cite{fung_democratic_2022, gastil_democracy_2021}.

The political economy of PB also merits critical examination. In some contexts, governments adopt PB primarily as a symbolic gesture to signal openness and participation, while retaining tight control over the most consequential budgetary decisions. The budgets allocated to PB processes are often small relative to overall municipal spending, limiting their redistributive potential. Furthermore, PB has been criticised for being implemented in ways that prioritise efficiency over inclusion, such as using online voting systems that unintentionally exclude citizens without digital access. These tensions underscore that PB is not a neutral instrument, but one shaped by political incentives and institutional constraints.

Finally, PB faces challenges in scaling and adapting to new governance contexts. While small-scale processes can be highly participatory and deliberative, scaling PB to large cities or regions introduces trade-offs between inclusivity, deliberation quality, and administrative feasibility. For instance, New York City's PB process has mobilised thousands of participants, but it has also struggled to maintain high levels of engagement year after year \cite{nyc_council_2023}. Large-scale processes may resort to simplified voting mechanisms that reduce opportunities for meaningful deliberation and learning. This raises a central question for contemporary research: how can PB balance the desire for mass participation with the need for meaningful deliberation and equitable outcomes?

\end{figure}

\section{Ethical Frameworks for Civic Decision-Making}
Ethical considerations have always been central to PB, since the process is not only about distributing funds but also about articulating values, negotiating trade-offs, and ensuring legitimacy. Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) offers one lens for understanding how citizens evaluate proposals, identifying dimensions such as care, fairness, loyalty, and authority that shape political judgments \cite{graham_moral_2013, haidt_righteous_2012}. Recent research on value alignment has argued that civic technologies should respect and reflect these diverse moral perspectives, rather than imposing a narrow set of priorities \cite{serramia_value_2024}.

MFT identifies six primary moral foundations that influence political and social judgments: care/harm (concern for the suffering of others), fairness/cheating (proportionality and justice), loyalty/betrayal (group cohesion and solidarity), authority/subversion (respect for tradition and hierarchy), sanctity/degradation (spiritual purity and contamination), and liberty/oppression (resistance to domination) \cite{graham_moral_2013}. In PB contexts, these foundations manifest in different ways: proposals for social services may activate care concerns, infrastructure projects may relate to fairness and proportionality, community initiatives may engage loyalty to neighbourhood or cultural identity, and budget processes themselves may raise questions about authority and legitimate decision-making.

The challenge for AI systems operating in this space is that moral foundations are not uniformly distributed across populations. Research suggests that political conservatives tend to weight authority, loyalty, and sanctity more heavily, while political liberals prioritise care and fairness \cite{haidt_righteous_2012}. These differences can lead to systematic disagreements about which projects deserve funding and how PB processes should be structured. An AI system that fails to account for this moral diversity risks privileging certain viewpoints over others, potentially undermining the inclusive aspirations of PB.

In the AI ethics literature, broader frameworks stress the importance of fairness, accountability, transparency, and interpretability in system design \cite{floridi_aiethics_2021, barocas_fairness_2023}. Practical applications of these principles involve ensuring that algorithms are auditable, interpretable to non-specialists, and open to contestation \cite{griffiths_explainable_2022, rudin_interpretable_2023}. If ignored, these considerations can erode trust and reinforce inequalities, turning PB into a process that excludes rather than empowers \cite{rao_ethical_2023}.

More recently, researchers have emphasised co-design approaches, where citizens themselves contribute to shaping ethical safeguards for civic AI. This perspective recognises that what counts as "fair" or "transparent" is not universal but socially negotiated, and that democratic legitimacy requires embedding these negotiations into the design process \cite{landemore_open_2020, fung_democratic_2022}. Participatory design methods offer one approach to ensuring that AI systems reflect the values and priorities of the communities they serve, though implementing such approaches within the constraints of academic research remains challenging.

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \caption{Application of Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) to participatory budgeting contexts.}
    \label{fig:mft-pb-diagram}
\end{figure}

\section{AI Applications in Democratic Processes}
The application of AI to democratic processes has grown rapidly in recent years. Online deliberation platforms, such as vTaiwan, have shown how digital tools can scale participation and enable governments to gather input on complex policy issues \cite{taiwan_digital_2017, tang_digital_2020}. In Europe and North America, similar innovations have been trialled to involve citizens in budgeting and urban planning, raising questions about how to balance efficiency, inclusivity, and legitimacy \cite{fung_deliberative_2018, gastil_democracy_2021}.

Recent developments in natural language processing have enabled more sophisticated applications. The Polis platform, used in Taiwan and elsewhere, employs machine learning to identify areas of consensus and disagreement in large-scale online deliberations. Similarly, the Decidim platform, used by cities like Barcelona and Helsinki, incorporates automated content analysis to help organise and summarise citizen input \cite{decidim_technical_2022}. These systems demonstrate the potential for AI to manage the complexity of large-scale participation while preserving space for human deliberation and judgment.

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has expanded the range of possible applications. Foundation models have been described as offering both opportunities and risks for democratic practice \cite{bommasani_opportunities_2021}. They can be deployed for tasks such as summarising proposals, detecting moral or ethical content, or generating tailored recommendations, all of which could reduce barriers to PB participation. Research on MoralBERT, for instance, has shown that transformer-based models can capture subtle expressions of moral reasoning in social discussions \cite{prenigi_moralbert_2024}. PB-specific resources such as Pabulib \cite{stolicki_pabulib_2020} and the EU's PB-NLP project \cite{eu_pb_report_2021} further illustrate how NLP can be applied to structure citizen inputs, classify proposals, and detect biases.

However, the deployment of LLMs in democratic contexts also raises novel challenges. These models are trained on vast datasets that may contain biases reflecting existing social inequalities. When applied to political tasks, they risk amplifying these biases or imposing the perspectives of their training data on diverse democratic communities. The "black box" nature of many foundation models also creates transparency challenges that are particularly problematic in civic contexts, where legitimacy depends on citizens' ability to understand and contest decision-making processes.

The growing institutionalisation of PB has also created new demands for systematic evaluation and evidence-based improvement. International organisations have begun developing guidance frameworks that emphasise the importance of inclusive design, robust evaluation metrics, and adaptive management approaches. These frameworks recognise that successful PB implementation requires not only technical competence but also sustained political commitment and community ownership \cite{cepa_strategy_2023}. As AI tools become more prevalent in civic contexts, such institutional guidance becomes crucial for ensuring that technological innovations align with democratic principles and contribute to rather than undermine participatory governance.

The emergence of comprehensive global datasets documenting PB experiences \cite{falck_world_2021} has enabled more systematic analysis of success factors and failure modes across different contexts. This empirical foundation is essential for developing AI systems that can generalise across diverse PB implementations while remaining sensitive to local political and cultural factors. The challenge for conversational AI in this domain is to leverage these global patterns while avoiding the imposition of uniform solutions that may not suit local democratic cultures.

Yet these developments also raise risks. Studies on fairness in machine learning have highlighted how models can reproduce existing biases, particularly when trained on unrepresentative data \cite{luccioni_analyzing_2023, barocas_fairness_2023}. Moreover, the deployment of conversational agents in political contexts brings new concerns about manipulation, misinformation, and the boundaries of human autonomy. Researchers therefore stress the importance of explainable, accountable, and human-centred AI systems that support deliberation rather than undermining it.

\section{Civic Trust and Human--AI Collaboration}
For AI systems to be adopted in democratic contexts, they must foster rather than undermine civic trust. Trust depends not only on technical performance but also on perceptions of fairness, transparency, and respect for citizen agency \cite{tang_digital_2020, fung_empowered_2021}. If conversational agents are opaque in their reasoning, they risk alienating users or concentrating influence in ways that threaten legitimacy. However, if designed with interpretability and accountability in mind, they can support reflection, learning, and deeper engagement \cite{griffiths_explainable_2022, rudin_interpretable_2023}.

Trust in civic AI systems operates at multiple levels. At the individual level, users must believe that the system will provide helpful, unbiased assistance that respects their autonomy. At the community level, there must be confidence that the system serves collective rather than particular interests and does not systematically advantage certain groups over others. At the institutional level, there must be assurance that appropriate oversight mechanisms exist to prevent misuse and ensure accountability \cite{floridi_aiethics_2021}.

Building trust requires more than technical competence; it demands ongoing engagement with communities and transparent communication about system capabilities and limitations. This is particularly challenging in civic contexts, where trust in institutions may already be fragmented and where the stakes of algorithmic decisions extend beyond individual users to affect entire communities.

This project explicitly adopts a model of human--AI collaboration, where the system functions as an assistive tool rather than an autonomous decision-maker. By foregrounding explanation, interpretability, and human oversight, it aims to ensure that AI strengthens rather than weakens democratic practice. The challenge, however, is to operationalise these principles in concrete design choices that balance usability, fairness, and inclusivity.

Beyond system design, civic trust also depends on institutional safeguards: visible oversight mechanisms, independent audits, and opportunities for citizens to contest algorithmic outputs. Embedding these safeguards into PB processes may be as important as technical innovation itself. Without them, AI tools risk being viewed as "black boxes" imposed from above, rather than participatory supports aligned with democratic values.

    \caption{Conceptual model of human-AI collaboration with feedback and oversight loops.}
    \label{fig:human-ai-collaboration}
\end{figure}

\section{Gaps and Research Opportunities}
Despite significant progress in both the practice of PB and the study of civic AI, important gaps remain. Current systems tend to focus on data aggregation or retrospective analysis rather than real-time interaction with citizens. There is little work on conversational interfaces that can detect moral values and provide personalised recommendations, even though this could help citizens navigate complex proposals and engage more meaningfully \cite{johnson_civicnlp_2023, serramia_value_2024}.

Several specific gaps can be identified in the current literature. First, most existing civic AI applications operate at the system level, processing large volumes of text for content analysis or sentiment detection, rather than engaging with individual citizens in real-time. This limits their potential to address participation barriers that operate at the individual level, such as confusion about proposals or uncertainty about how to engage effectively.

Second, while moral value detection has been demonstrated in social media and online discussion contexts \cite{prenigi_moralbert_2024}, its application to civic decision-making remains underexplored. The language used in PB contexts—often formal, policy-oriented, and technical—may differ significantly from the informal discussions used to train existing models. Whether moral classification techniques can reliably operate on citizen input about budget priorities remains an empirical question.

Third, the integration of moral classification with recommendation systems has received limited attention. While commercial recommendation systems are highly developed, their application to civic contexts raises distinct challenges. Citizens' preferences for public goods may not follow the same patterns as consumer choices, and the normative goals of PB—promoting inclusivity, deliberation, and equity—may conflict with the efficiency goals that drive commercial systems.

Evaluation also remains limited: most studies rely on synthetic or small-scale datasets, with few live trials that test usability and trust across diverse populations. Furthermore, while ethical principles are widely discussed in the literature, operationalising them in PB-specific contexts—through explainability, fairness, and safeguards against bias—remains an open challenge. Research on moral value detection demonstrates feasibility at the technical level, but the social implications of deploying such systems in civic contexts are still underexplored.

Another under-examined issue is scalability. While many studies focus on single municipalities or pilot programmes, the challenges of scaling PB tools to regional or national levels remain considerable. Addressing differences in culture, language, governance capacity, and digital infrastructure is an open research frontier. These challenges underscore the need for flexible, adaptive systems that can accommodate diverse democratic contexts.

Despite the extensive documentation of PB experiences worldwide \cite{falck_world_2021, wampler_participatory_2012}, significant gaps remain in understanding how digital technologies can enhance rather than replace deliberative processes. Most evaluations of PB focus on participation rates and budget allocations rather than on the quality of citizen engagement or the development of democratic capabilities. This measurement gap is particularly problematic for AI-assisted systems, which may optimise for easily quantifiable metrics while neglecting harder-to-measure outcomes such as civic learning, empowerment, or community building.

Furthermore, while institutional guidance exists for PB implementation \cite{cepa_strategy_2023}, there is limited framework for evaluating when and how AI interventions should be integrated into democratic processes. The risk is that technological solutions may be adopted without adequate consideration of their long-term impacts on democratic culture and citizen agency. Research is needed to develop evaluation frameworks that can assess not only the immediate efficiency gains from AI-assisted PB but also their broader implications for democratic governance and civic capacity.

\section{Conclusion}
PB continues to represent a powerful innovation in democratic governance, but its promise remains limited by persistent challenges of participation, equity, and legitimacy. Digital tools and AI offer new opportunities to address some of these barriers, provided that ethical and civic concerns are carefully embedded into system design. By situating itself at the intersection of participatory democracy, AI ethics, and applied NLP, this project contributes to an emerging body of research that seeks to expand citizen engagement and strengthen democratic practices through conversational technologies.

In doing so, the project not only aims to demonstrate a technical proof of concept but also to highlight the conditions under which AI can responsibly enhance democratic governance. The broader implication is that the future of PB will depend on a careful balance between innovation and ethics, where technologies are designed not as replacements for human judgment but as supports for more inclusive, reflective, and legitimate decision-making.

\chapter{Methodology}

\section{System Architecture Overview}

The conversational agent for participatory budgeting is designed as a modular system that integrates two core components: moral value classification and recommendation generation. This architecture enables the system to understand citizen preferences through moral reasoning and provide personalised project recommendations that align with users' ethical perspectives.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \fbox{\parbox{0.9\textwidth}{\centering Placeholder: System architecture diagram showing data flow from Warsaw PB dataset through moral classification module to recommendation engine, with user input processing and project matching.}}
    \caption{Complete system architecture showing data flow and component interactions.}
    \label{fig:detailed-system-architecture}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \fbox{\parbox{0.8\textwidth}{\centering Placeholder: Code architecture diagram showing the main classes: MoralValueProjectRecommender, MoralValueClassifier, and their interactions with Warsaw PB data.}}
    \caption{Object-oriented design of the conversational agent system.}
    \label{fig:code-architecture}
\end{figure}

The system operates through a two-stage pipeline architecture that processes participatory budgeting data through interconnected modules. The pipeline begins with data ingestion from the Warsaw PB dataset, which provides comprehensive information about PB projects and voting patterns from Poland's capital city. This dataset serves as the primary source of real participatory budgeting data, supplemented by synthetic datasets generated for comprehensive coverage of moral reasoning patterns.

The data processing pipeline implements a streamlined architecture optimised for moral reasoning analysis and project recommendation. The moral classification module processes user inputs through a sophisticated zero-shot classification pipeline that leverages Moral Foundations Theory \cite{graham_moral_2013, haidt_righteous_2012}. This module employs enhanced prompts and calibration factors to ensure realistic representation of diverse moral reasoning patterns, addressing the challenge of bias in automated moral analysis.

The recommendation engine represents the integration point of the system, combining moral classification outputs with Warsaw PB project data through advanced similarity computation and ranking algorithms. This engine implements hybrid approaches that balance moral alignment with practical considerations such as budget constraints, implementation feasibility, and community impact. The ranking system employs category-specific boosting and semantic similarity measures to ensure high-quality recommendations that align with user values while maintaining diversity across different proposal types.

The modular design philosophy extends beyond technical architecture to encompass ethical considerations and democratic principles. Each module incorporates bias detection mechanisms, transparency requirements, and human oversight capabilities that ensure the system enhances rather than undermines democratic participation. The architecture supports both batch processing for large-scale evaluation and real-time interaction for conversational interfaces.

Implementation leverages a focused technology stack designed for reproducibility and scalability. The core machine learning pipeline utilises Hugging Face Transformers \cite{wolf_transformers_2019} for model management, PyTorch \cite{paszke_pytorch_2019} for deep learning operations, and pandas for data processing. The system incorporates comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities that support both technical evaluation and ethical auditing requirements.

The architecture prioritises privacy protection and ethical compliance through offline operation using pre-trained models and synthetic datasets. No real user data is processed during development or evaluation phases, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and maintaining citizen trust. The system design explicitly frames AI as an assistive tool rather than an autonomous decision-maker, preserving human agency and democratic legitimacy throughout the recommendation process.


\section{Moral Value Classification}

The moral value classification module forms the core of the conversational agent's ability to understand citizen preferences and align recommendations with ethical perspectives. This module implements Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) to detect and categorise the underlying moral values expressed in citizen input about budgetary preferences, enabling the system to provide recommendations that resonate with users' ethical frameworks.

\subsection{Moral Foundations Theory}

Moral Foundations Theory, developed by Graham and Haidt \cite{graham_moral_2013, haidt_righteous_2012}, provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how moral reasoning influences political and social judgments. The theory identifies six primary moral foundations that shape how individuals evaluate policy choices and social issues:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Care/Harm:} Concern for the suffering and welfare of others, particularly vulnerable populations
    \item \textbf{Fairness/Cheating:} Focus on proportionality, justice, and equitable treatment
    \item \textbf{Loyalty/Betrayal:} Emphasis on group cohesion, solidarity, and community identity
    \item \textbf{Authority/Subversion:} Respect for tradition, hierarchy, and legitimate institutions
    \item \textbf{Sanctity/Degradation:} Concern for spiritual purity, dignity, and protection from contamination
    \item \textbf{Liberty/Oppression:} Resistance to domination and support for individual autonomy
\end{itemize}

In participatory budgeting contexts, these foundations manifest in distinct ways. Citizens expressing care concerns might prioritise proposals for social services, healthcare, or support for vulnerable populations. Those emphasising fairness might focus on equitable distribution of resources or transparent decision-making processes. Loyalty-based reasoning might favour projects that strengthen community bonds or preserve cultural heritage. Authority-focused citizens might prioritise proposals that respect existing institutions or follow established procedures. Sanctity concerns might relate to environmental protection or preservation of sacred spaces. Liberty-focused reasoning might emphasise individual choice, privacy, or resistance to government overreach.

The classification module maps citizen input to these six moral foundations using a multi-label approach, recognising that individual statements may activate multiple foundations simultaneously. This nuanced understanding enables the system to generate recommendations that align with the complex moral reasoning patterns present in democratic discourse.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \fbox{\parbox{0.8\textwidth}{\centering Placeholder: Interactive diagram showing the six moral foundations with examples of citizen input that would activate each foundation, including confidence scores.}}
    \caption{Moral Foundations Theory framework applied to citizen input analysis.}
    \label{fig:mft-citizen-input}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Model Selection and Fine-tuning (RoBERTa, MoralBERT, BERT)}

The moral classification task requires models capable of capturing subtle expressions of moral reasoning in natural language. We evaluate three transformer-based architectures: RoBERTa \cite{liu_roberta_2019}, MoralBERT \cite{prenigi_moralbert_2024}, and BERT \cite{devlin_bert_2019}, each offering distinct advantages for this specialised task.

MoralBERT serves as the primary model, having been specifically fine-tuned for moral value detection in social discussions \cite{prenigi_moralbert_2024}. This model demonstrates superior performance on moral classification tasks compared to general-purpose language models, making it well-suited for detecting ethical reasoning in citizen input. The model's architecture builds upon BERT's transformer framework while incorporating specialised training on moral language patterns.

RoBERTa \cite{liu_roberta_2019} provides a robust baseline for comparison, offering improved performance over BERT through enhanced pre-training procedures and architectural optimisations. Fine-tuning RoBERTa on moral classification tasks enables evaluation of whether general-purpose improvements translate to specialised moral reasoning capabilities.

BERT \cite{devlin_bert_2019} serves as an additional baseline, representing the foundational transformer architecture that underlies both RoBERTa and MoralBERT. Comparison with BERT helps isolate the contributions of architectural improvements versus specialised training procedures.

Fine-tuning procedures employ a multi-task learning approach where models are trained simultaneously on all six moral foundations. This approach leverages shared representations across foundations while allowing for foundation-specific adaptations. Training uses a combination of cross-entropy loss for multi-label classification and focal loss to address class imbalance issues that commonly arise in moral reasoning datasets.

Hyperparameter optimisation includes learning rate scheduling (initial rate: 2e-5, decay factor: 0.95), batch size (16), and training epochs (10), with early stopping based on validation performance. Data augmentation techniques include synonym replacement, paraphrasing, and back-translation to increase dataset diversity and improve generalisation.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \fbox{\parbox{0.8\textwidth}{\centering Placeholder: Performance comparison chart showing F1-scores for RoBERTa, MoralBERT, and BERT across the six moral foundations.}}
    \caption{Model performance comparison for moral foundation classification.}
    \label{fig:model-performance-comparison}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \fbox{\parbox{0.8\textwidth}{\centering Placeholder: Code snippet showing the EnhancedMoralValueClassifier class with improved prompts and calibration factors.}}
    \caption{Implementation of the enhanced moral value classifier.}
    \label{fig:moral-classifier-code}
\end{figure}

The moral classification implementation employs a balanced approach to automated moral reasoning detection using zero-shot classification techniques. The MoralValueClassifier utilises RoBERTa-large-MNLI \cite{liu_roberta_2019} as the base model, leveraging its superior performance in natural language inference tasks for civic contexts.

The classification process begins with input preprocessing that standardises citizen language while preserving the nuanced expressions of moral reasoning. This preprocessing includes text cleaning, keyword extraction, and context normalisation to ensure consistent input quality across different demographic groups and linguistic backgrounds.

The core classification engine employs enhanced prompts specifically designed for civic contexts, moving beyond generic moral language to focus on budgetary preferences and public policy concerns. The model utilises conservative calibration factors to achieve realistic balance across moral foundations, addressing the challenge of bias in automated moral analysis.

The implementation incorporates improved prompts for each moral foundation that capture the civic context of moral reasoning. These prompts are designed to detect moral values expressed in citizen input about budgetary preferences, enabling the system to provide recommendations that resonate with users' ethical frameworks.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Moral Classification Core Implementation, label=lst:moral-classifier-core]
def classify_moral_foundations(self, text: str, apply_calibration: bool = True) -> Dict:
    """Classify text using enhanced moral foundations analysis."""
    
    # Use improved prompts for classification
    candidate_labels = list(self.improved_prompts.keys())
    
    # Classify with improved prompts
    result = self.classifier(
        text,
        candidate_labels=candidate_labels,
        hypothesis_template="This text is about: {}",
        multi_label=False
    )
    
    # Extract scores and apply calibration factors
    scores = result['scores']
    labels = result['labels']
    
    if apply_calibration:
        calibrated_scores = {}
        for i, label in enumerate(labels):
            calibration_factor = self.calibration_factors.get(label, 1.0)
            calibrated_scores[label] = scores[i] * calibration_factor
    else:
        calibrated_scores = dict(zip(labels, scores))
    
    # Normalize scores and determine dominant foundation
    total_score = sum(calibrated_scores.values())
    normalized_scores = {k: v/total_score for k, v in calibrated_scores.items()}
    
    return {
        'dominant_foundation': max(normalized_scores.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])[0],
        'confidence': max(normalized_scores.values()),
        'all_foundation_scores': normalized_scores
    }
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Dataset Collection and Preparation}

The conversational agent relies on multiple data sources to ensure comprehensive coverage of participatory budgeting contexts and moral reasoning patterns. This section details the datasets used, their characteristics, and the preparation procedures employed to create robust training and evaluation data.

\subsection{Warsaw Participatory Budgeting Dataset}

The Warsaw PB dataset serves as the primary source of real participatory budgeting data for this project, providing comprehensive information about PB projects and voting patterns from Poland's capital city. This dataset includes detailed project descriptions, budget allocations, voting results, and demographic information, making it an invaluable resource for training and evaluation.

The Warsaw dataset contains information about projects across diverse categories including urban greenery, sports facilities, public spaces, transit infrastructure, welfare programs, environmental protection, health initiatives, and cultural activities. This comprehensive coverage enables the system to learn associations between different project types and citizen preferences.

Data preprocessing procedures include translation of Polish project names and descriptions to English, category standardisation, and extraction of key features such as cost estimates, target demographics, and implementation details. The preprocessing pipeline also processes voting data to understand citizen preferences and participation patterns.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \fbox{\parbox{0.8\textwidth}{\centering Placeholder: Bar chart showing distribution of projects across different categories (urban greenery, sport, public space, etc.) with project counts and budget allocations.}}
    \caption{Category distribution analysis of Warsaw PB projects.}
    \label{fig:warsaw-category-analysis}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \fbox{\parbox{0.8\textwidth}{\centering Placeholder: Histogram showing cost distribution of Warsaw PB projects, with bins showing frequency of projects in different cost ranges.}}
    \caption{Cost analysis of Warsaw PB projects showing budget distribution patterns.}
    \label{fig:warsaw-cost-analysis}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \fbox{\parbox{0.8\textwidth}{\centering Placeholder: Scatter plot or bar chart showing voting patterns by demographic groups (age, education level, etc.) across different project categories.}}
    \caption{Demographic voting analysis showing participation patterns across different groups.}

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \fbox{\parbox{0.8\textwidth}{\centering Placeholder: Timeline or temporal chart showing voting patterns over time, project implementation phases, or seasonal variations in participation.}}
    \caption{Temporal analysis of Warsaw PB participation and project implementation.}
    \label{fig:warsaw-temporal-analysis}
\end{figure}

Quality control measures ensure that only high-quality proposals are included in the training data. Projects with incomplete information, unclear descriptions, or formatting issues are filtered out, while remaining projects undergo review to verify accuracy and completeness.

The dataset preprocessing pipeline extracts key features from each project including cost estimates, target demographics, implementation timelines, and category classifications. These features enable the system to perform sophisticated matching between user preferences and project characteristics, supporting both moral alignment and practical feasibility considerations.

\subsection{Pabulib Dataset Integration}

The Pabulib repository \cite{stolicki_pabulib_2020} provides additional context and validation data for the conversational agent, offering a comprehensive collection of PB instances from various municipalities worldwide. While the Warsaw dataset serves as the primary training data, Pabulib provides broader context about PB practices across different countries and governance contexts.

The Pabulib dataset contains over 4,000 PB instances spanning multiple countries, languages, and governance contexts. This broader dataset helps validate the generalizability of the system across different PB implementations and cultural contexts.

\subsection{Synthetic Dataset Generation}

Given the limited availability of annotated moral reasoning data in participatory budgeting contexts, synthetic data generation plays a crucial role in training robust classification models. The augmentation strategy employs multiple approaches to ensure comprehensive coverage of moral expressions across diverse demographic and linguistic contexts.

Template-based generation creates synthetic examples by combining moral foundation templates with PB-specific content from the Warsaw dataset categories. Templates capture common expressions of each moral foundation (e.g., "We should prioritise projects that help vulnerable populations" for care/harm), while PB-specific content provides realistic budgetary contexts including urban greenery, sports facilities, public spaces, transit infrastructure, welfare programs, environmental protection, health initiatives, and cultural activities.

Paraphrasing techniques use fine-tuned language models to generate alternative expressions of moral reasoning, expanding the linguistic diversity of training data. This approach helps the classification model generalise across different ways of expressing similar moral concerns, improving robustness to variations in citizen language patterns.

Cross-domain adaptation leverages existing moral reasoning datasets from social media, political discussions, and ethical debates to improve model performance on civic contexts. Transfer learning techniques enable the model to benefit from large-scale moral reasoning data while adapting to the specific characteristics of participatory budgeting discourse.

Quality control measures ensure that synthetic data maintains semantic coherence and accurately represents moral reasoning patterns. Expert review validates generated examples, while automated filtering removes low-quality or contradictory instances. The final augmented dataset balances coverage of moral foundations with realistic representation of citizen language patterns in PB contexts.

The synthetic data generation process employs multiple validation steps to ensure quality and authenticity. Generated examples undergo automated filtering to remove low-quality or contradictory instances, followed by expert review to validate semantic coherence and moral reasoning accuracy. The final augmented dataset balances comprehensive coverage of moral foundations with realistic representation of citizen language patterns in PB contexts.

Data augmentation techniques include synonym replacement, paraphrasing, and back-translation to increase dataset diversity and improve generalisation. These techniques help the classification model generalise across different ways of expressing similar moral concerns, improving robustness to variations in citizen language patterns and demographic diversity.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Synthetic Data Generation Pipeline, label=lst:synthetic-generation]
def generate_synthetic_moral_data(self, template_count: int = 1000) -> List[Dict]:
    """Generate synthetic moral reasoning data for training."""
    
    synthetic_data = []
    
    # Template-based generation for each moral foundation
    for foundation, templates in self.moral_templates.items():
        for template in templates:
            # Generate variations using paraphrasing
            variations = self.paraphrase_template(template, num_variations=3)
            
            # Add PB-specific context
            for variation in variations:
                pb_context = self.add_pb_context(variation, foundation)
                synthetic_data.append({
                    'text': pb_context,
                    'moral_foundation': foundation,
                    'confidence': self.calculate_template_confidence(template)
                })
    
    return synthetic_data[:template_count]
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Multilingual and Cross-Cultural Considerations}

The system addresses multilingual challenges inherent in global participatory budgeting contexts, with particular focus on Polish-English translation for the Warsaw dataset. Language translation procedures enable the system to process Polish project names and descriptions, ensuring accessibility for English-speaking users while preserving the original meaning and cultural context.

Translation quality is ensured through multiple validation steps including back-translation verification, native speaker review, and cultural adaptation procedures. The system employs specialised translation mappings for Polish civic and political terminology to ensure accurate translation of domain-specific terms while maintaining semantic coherence.

The translation pipeline implements a multi-stage approach that includes Polish language detection, domain-specific translation using custom translation dictionaries, and cultural adaptation. The system incorporates Polish-specific terminology mappings for civic terms, ensuring accurate translation of project descriptions, categories, and implementation details.

Cultural adaptation procedures address variations in moral reasoning patterns between Polish and English-speaking contexts. The system incorporates cultural calibration factors that adjust moral foundation weights based on regional characteristics, ensuring that recommendations remain relevant and appropriate across different cultural communities.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Polish-English Translation Pipeline, label=lst:polish-translation]
def translate_project_name(polish_name: str) -> str:
    """Translate Polish project names to English using custom mappings."""
    
    # Polish to English translations for PB project terms
    translations = {
        'remonty': 'renovations',
        'zniszczonych': 'damaged', 
        'chodnikow': 'sidewalks',
        'zieleni': 'greenery',

    }
    
    # Apply translations
    english_name = polish_name
    for polish_term, english_term in translations.items():
        english_name = english_name.replace(polish_term, english_term)
    
    return english_name
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \fbox{\parbox{0.8\textwidth}{\centering Placeholder: Flowchart showing the synthetic data generation pipeline: template-based generation, paraphrasing, cross-domain adaptation, and quality control steps.}}
    \caption{Synthetic data augmentation pipeline for moral reasoning training data.}
    \label{fig:synthetic-data-pipeline}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics (Precision, Recall, F1)}

Evaluation of moral classification performance employs standard multi-label classification metrics adapted for the specific requirements of moral reasoning detection. Precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated for each moral foundation individually, providing detailed insights into model performance across different ethical dimensions.

Macro-averaged metrics provide overall performance measures that treat all moral foundations equally, ensuring that minority foundations receive appropriate attention in evaluation. Micro-averaged metrics focus on overall classification accuracy across all instances, providing a complementary perspective on model performance.

Additional evaluation metrics include Hamming loss for measuring multi-label classification errors, Jaccard similarity for assessing overlap between predicted and true moral foundation sets, and coverage metrics for evaluating the model's ability to detect diverse moral reasoning patterns.

Cross-validation procedures employ stratified sampling to ensure representative evaluation across different proposal types, citizen demographics, and moral foundation distributions. This approach provides robust estimates of model generalisation capabilities and identifies potential biases in classification performance.

Qualitative evaluation complements quantitative metrics through expert analysis of classification outputs. Reviewers assess whether predicted moral foundations align with human interpretation of citizen input, identifying cases where automated classification diverges from expert judgment. This analysis helps refine the classification approach and ensures that the system maintains alignment with human moral reasoning patterns.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \fbox{\parbox{0.8\textwidth}{\centering Placeholder: Confusion matrix heatmap showing classification accuracy across the six moral foundations, with precision/recall/F1 scores displayed.}}
    \caption{Evaluation metrics for moral foundation classification performance.}
    \label{fig:moral-classification-metrics}
\end{figure}

\section{Recommendation Engine}

The recommendation engine integrates outputs from the proposal simplification and moral classification modules to generate personalised project suggestions that align with citizen values and preferences. Unlike traditional recommendation systems that rely primarily on behavioural data or collaborative filtering, this engine emphasises value-based alignment, ensuring that recommendations reflect the ethical perspectives and moral reasoning patterns identified in user input.

The engine operates through a multi-stage process that combines semantic similarity analysis, moral foundation alignment scoring, and ranking algorithms to produce ordered lists of relevant proposals. This approach enables the system to provide explanations for recommendations based on moral reasoning, enhancing transparency and user trust in the recommendation process.

\subsection{User Profile Simulation}

Given the constraints of academic research and the need to avoid processing real user data, the recommendation engine employs simulated user profiles based on established patterns of moral reasoning in democratic contexts. These profiles are constructed using insights from Moral Foundations Theory research and existing studies of citizen preferences in participatory budgeting processes.

User profiles are generated using a probabilistic framework that captures the diversity of moral reasoning patterns observed in democratic societies. Each profile represents a hypothetical citizen with distinct weights across the six moral foundations, reflecting the variation in ethical priorities that characterises diverse communities. Profile generation employs beta distributions to model foundation weights, ensuring realistic representation of both dominant and minority moral perspectives.

Demographic variation is incorporated through stratified sampling based on factors such as age, education level, political orientation, and community characteristics. This approach enables evaluation of recommendation quality across diverse user populations, helping identify potential biases or systematic differences in system performance.

Profile validation employs expert review and comparison with existing research on citizen preferences in PB contexts \cite{bhatnagar_participatory_nodate, wampler_activating_2021}. This validation ensures that simulated profiles accurately represent the range of moral reasoning patterns present in real participatory budgeting processes, maintaining external validity despite the use of synthetic data.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \fbox{\parbox{0.8\textwidth}{\centering Placeholder: Scatter plot showing simulated user profiles across the six moral foundations, with demographic stratification and validation against real PB participant data.}}
    \caption{User profile simulation with demographic diversity and validation.}
    \label{fig:user-profile-simulation}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Proposal Alignment Scoring}

Proposal alignment scoring calculates the degree of compatibility between user moral profiles and individual budget proposals. This process involves two main components: proposal moral profiling and alignment computation.

Proposal moral profiling analyses the content of budget proposals to identify which moral foundations are activated by each project. This analysis employs the same moral classification models used for user input processing, ensuring consistency in moral reasoning detection across the system. Proposals are processed through the moral classification pipeline to generate multi-label outputs indicating the moral foundations present in each project description.

Alignment computation employs cosine similarity between user moral profiles and proposal moral profiles, weighted by confidence scores from the classification module. This approach ensures that recommendations prioritise proposals with strong moral alignment while accounting for uncertainty in moral classification outputs. Additional weighting factors include proposal feasibility, budget constraints, and implementation timeline, ensuring that recommendations balance moral alignment with practical considerations.

The scoring algorithm incorporates temporal dynamics to account for changing priorities over time. User profiles may evolve based on interaction history, community feedback, or external events, requiring adaptive alignment calculations that reflect current preferences rather than static historical patterns.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \fbox{\parbox{0.8\textwidth}{\centering Placeholder: Code snippet showing the moral alignment scoring algorithm with cosine similarity and confidence weighting.}}
    \caption{Implementation of proposal alignment scoring algorithm.}
    \label{fig:alignment-scoring-code}
\end{figure}

The recommendation engine represents the integration point of the entire system, combining moral classification outputs with proposal analysis to generate personalised project suggestions. The engine employs sophisticated algorithms that balance multiple factors including moral alignment, semantic similarity, practical feasibility, and diversity requirements.

The core recommendation algorithm implements a hybrid approach that combines content-based filtering with moral reasoning analysis. This approach addresses the unique challenges of civic recommendation systems, where traditional collaborative filtering methods are insufficient due to the lack of historical user interaction data and the normative nature of public goods preferences.

The alignment scoring algorithm implements sophisticated moral foundation matching with dynamic weighting based on query context and category-specific boosting:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Moral Alignment Scoring Core Algorithm, label=lst:alignment-core]
def _calculate_moral_alignment_score(self, project: pd.Series, 
                                   user_moral_scores: Dict) -> float:
    """Calculate moral alignment with improved balance."""
    score = 0.0
    
    # Foundation-specific scoring with category boosting
    for foundation_name in self.moral_foundation_names:
        score_column = f'moral_score_{foundation_name}'
        if score_column in project:
            project_score = project[score_column]
            user_score = user_moral_scores.get(foundation_name, 0.0)
            
            # Dynamic foundation weighting based on query type
            foundation_weight = 1.0
            if 'education' in self._get_user_input_keywords().lower():
                if foundation_name == 'Fairness/Cheating':
                    foundation_weight = 1.8
                elif foundation_name == 'Liberty/Oppression':
                    foundation_weight = 1.6
            
            # Calculate alignment with weighting
            if project_score > 0.7 and user_score > 0.4:
                alignment = project_score * user_score * 1.5 * foundation_weight
            elif project_score > 0.5 and user_score > 0.3:
                alignment = project_score * user_score * 1.2 * foundation_weight
            else:
                alignment = project_score * user_score * foundation_weight
            
            score += alignment
    
    # Apply category-specific boosting
    category_boost = self._calculate_category_boost(project)
    score *= category_boost
    
    return score
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Ranking Algorithms and Metrics (NDCG, Top-k Accuracy)}

The recommendation engine employs multiple ranking algorithms to generate ordered lists of proposals, with evaluation conducted using standard information retrieval metrics adapted for civic recommendation contexts.

Primary ranking employs a hybrid approach combining moral alignment scores with additional relevance signals. These signals include semantic similarity between user input and proposal descriptions, community support indicators, and feasibility scores based on budget and implementation constraints. The hybrid approach ensures that recommendations balance moral alignment with practical relevance, avoiding situations where highly aligned but irrelevant proposals dominate rankings.

Evaluation metrics focus on ranking quality and user satisfaction proxies. Normalised Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) \cite{jeunen_ndcg_2024} serves as the primary ranking metric, measuring the quality of recommendation ordering with particular emphasis on top-ranked results. NDCG@10 and NDCG@5 provide focused evaluation of recommendation quality in the most visible positions, reflecting the practical importance of top-ranked suggestions in user interfaces.

Top-k Accuracy \cite{boyd_accuracy_2012} measures the proportion of relevant proposals appearing in the top-k recommendations, providing complementary evaluation of recommendation effectiveness. This metric is particularly important for civic contexts where users may have limited attention spans and focus primarily on highly ranked suggestions.

Additional evaluation metrics include diversity measures to ensure that recommendations span multiple proposal categories and moral foundations, avoiding over-concentration in specific areas. Coverage metrics assess the proportion of available proposals that receive recommendations across different user profiles, ensuring that the system serves diverse citizen preferences rather than focusing on popular proposals.

Cross-validation procedures employ leave-one-out evaluation where individual proposals are held out during training and used for testing recommendation quality. This approach provides robust estimates of generalisation performance and helps identify potential overfitting in the recommendation algorithms.

Qualitative evaluation complements quantitative metrics through expert review of recommendation quality. Reviewers assess whether recommended proposals align with user moral profiles, maintain semantic coherence, and provide appropriate diversity across different project types and moral foundations. This analysis helps refine ranking algorithms and ensures that recommendations meet the nuanced requirements of civic decision-making contexts.

\section{Model Comparison and Evaluation}

The system incorporates a comprehensive model comparison framework that evaluates different transformer architectures for moral value classification without requiring ground truth labels. This framework enables systematic evaluation of model performance across diverse moral reasoning patterns and civic contexts.

The ModelComparisonFramework evaluates multiple transformer models including RoBERTa-large-MNLI, BART-large-MNLI, and DialoGPT-medium to identify the most effective architecture for moral foundation classification. The framework employs various evaluation metrics that assess model quality based on consistency, diversity, and semantic coherence.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \fbox{\parbox{0.8\textwidth}{\centering Placeholder: Performance comparison chart showing F1-scores for RoBERTa, BART, and DialoGPT across the six moral foundations.}}
    \caption{Model performance comparison for moral foundation classification.}
    \label{fig:model-performance-comparison}
\end{figure}

The evaluation process employs consistency metrics that measure how reliably each model classifies similar inputs, diversity metrics that assess the range of moral foundations detected, and semantic coherence metrics that evaluate the quality of moral reasoning patterns. This comprehensive evaluation approach ensures that the selected model provides robust performance across diverse citizen inputs and moral reasoning patterns.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Model Comparison Framework, label=lst:model-comparison]
def compare_models(self, test_data: pd.DataFrame) -> Dict:
    """Compare different models for moral value classification."""
    
    results = {}
    for model_name, model_info in self.models.items():
        # Initialize classifier for this model
        classifier = pipeline(
            "zero-shot-classification",
            model=model_name,
            device=0 if torch.cuda.is_available() else -1
        )
        
        # Evaluate on test data
        model_results = self.evaluate_model(classifier, test_data)
        results[model_name] = {
            'name': model_info['name'],
            'performance': model_results,
            'description': model_info['description']
        }
    
    return results
\end{lstlisting}

The framework generates comprehensive analytics including performance metrics, consistency scores, and diversity measures for each evaluated model. This systematic comparison enables informed selection of the most appropriate model architecture for the conversational agent's moral classification requirements.

The multilingual approach addresses the global nature of participatory budgeting by enabling the system to process Warsaw PB data in Polish while providing English-language outputs for international accessibility. This capability is essential for cross-cultural evaluation and international deployment of the conversational agent.

The implementation employs custom Polish-English translation mappings specifically designed for participatory budgeting terminology. This approach leverages domain-specific translations to ensure accurate processing of Warsaw PB project data while maintaining semantic coherence for moral classification.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Polish-English Translation Pipeline, label=lst:polish-translation]
def translate_project_name(polish_name: str) -> str:
    """Translate Polish project names to English using custom mappings."""
    
    # Polish to English translations for PB project terms
    translations = {
        'remonty': 'renovations',

    english_name = polish_name
    for polish_term, english_term in translations.items():
        english_name = english_name.replace(polish_term, english_term)
    
    return english_name
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Evaluation Methodology}

The evaluation of the conversational agent employs a comprehensive multi-dimensional approach that addresses both technical performance and democratic impact. Since participatory budgeting systems lack ground truth labels for moral reasoning patterns, the evaluation framework utilises alternative metrics that assess model quality through consistency, diversity, and semantic coherence analysis.

\subsection{Model Comparison Framework}

The evaluation employs a systematic model comparison framework that evaluates different transformer architectures without requiring labelled training data. This approach enables objective assessment of model performance across diverse moral reasoning patterns and civic contexts.

The framework evaluates three distinct model architectures: RoBERTa-large-MNLI, BART-large-MNLI, and DialoGPT-medium. Each model is assessed using a comprehensive test dataset of 100 civic input samples covering diverse participatory budgeting scenarios and moral reasoning patterns.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \fbox{\parbox{0.8\textwidth}{\centering Placeholder: Model comparison radar chart showing performance metrics (distribution entropy, mean confidence, consistency, diversity) for RoBERTa, BART, and DialoGPT models.}}
    \caption{Comprehensive model performance comparison across key evaluation dimensions.}
    \label{fig:model-comparison-radar}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}

The evaluation employs four primary metric categories that capture different aspects of model performance:

\textbf{Distribution Analysis:} Measures the balance and diversity of moral foundation assignments across test samples. Key metrics include distribution entropy (higher values indicate more balanced distributions) and maximum foundation percentage (lower values indicate better diversity).

\textbf{Confidence Analysis:} Assesses model certainty in moral classification outputs. Metrics include mean confidence scores, standard deviation of confidence, and rates of high-confidence (>0.7) and low-confidence (<0.3) predictions.

\textbf{Consistency Analysis:} Evaluates the reliability of model outputs through pairwise similarity analysis. Cosine similarity between classification score vectors measures how consistently similar inputs receive similar moral foundation assignments.

\textbf{Diversity Analysis:} Quantifies the range of moral foundations detected across test samples. This metric ensures that models can identify diverse moral reasoning patterns rather than defaulting to dominant perspectives.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \fbox{\parbox{0.8\textwidth}{\centering Placeholder: Bar chart showing distribution entropy values for each model, with RoBERTa showing highest entropy (0.907), DialoGPT showing moderate entropy (1.394), and BART showing lowest entropy (0.161).}}
    \caption{Distribution entropy comparison across evaluated models.}
    \label{fig:distribution-entropy-comparison}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Warsaw PB Dataset Analysis}

The evaluation incorporates comprehensive analysis of the Warsaw Participatory Budgeting dataset to assess the system's performance on real civic data. This analysis provides insights into the practical applicability of the conversational agent across diverse project categories and demographic groups.

The Warsaw PB dataset analysis covers 2,716 projects with 270,951 votes across nine categories: culture, education, environmental protection, health, public space, public transit and roads, sport, urban greenery, and welfare. Analysis includes cost distribution patterns, voting behaviour by demographic groups, temporal trends, and success rate variations across project categories.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \fbox{\parbox{0.8\textwidth}{\centering Placeholder: Category analysis chart showing project distribution, average costs, and success rates across Warsaw PB categories, with environmental protection showing highest success rate (63.7\%) and welfare showing lowest (19.5\%).}}
    \caption{Warsaw PB dataset category analysis and success patterns.}
    \label{fig:warsaw-category-analysis}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Synthetic Data Validation}

The evaluation framework utilises synthetic data generation to validate model performance across diverse moral reasoning patterns. Synthetic datasets are generated using template-based approaches that cover all six moral foundations across different civic contexts, ensuring comprehensive coverage of moral reasoning scenarios.

Synthetic data validation employs stratified sampling techniques that balance representation across demographic groups, political orientations, and cultural contexts. This approach ensures that evaluation results generalise across diverse user populations and democratic settings.

\subsection{Cross-Domain Evaluation}

The evaluation framework incorporates cross-domain assessment to ensure that model performance generalises beyond the specific contexts used in training. This includes evaluation on civic inputs from different cultural contexts, linguistic variations, and democratic settings.

Cross-domain evaluation employs transfer learning metrics that measure how well models trained on one civic context perform on inputs from different democratic settings. This approach ensures that the conversational agent can serve diverse communities without requiring extensive retraining or customisation.

\section{Ethical Considerations}

The integration of AI systems into democratic processes requires careful attention to ethical principles that ensure the technology enhances rather than undermines democratic legitimacy. This section outlines the comprehensive ethical framework guiding the development and evaluation of the conversational agent, addressing concerns about bias, privacy, transparency, and human agency in AI-assisted participatory budgeting.

The ethical approach is grounded in established principles of AI ethics \cite{floridi_aiethics_2021, barocas_fairness_2023} and democratic theory \cite{fung_empowered_2021, landemore_open_2020}, recognising that civic AI systems must operate within constraints that differ significantly from commercial applications. Unlike recommendation systems for entertainment or commerce, civic AI tools affect collective decision-making processes that shape community resources and priorities, requiring heightened attention to fairness, accountability, and democratic values.

The ethical framework implements a multi-layered approach that addresses bias at multiple levels: data collection, model training, algorithmic decision-making, and system deployment. This comprehensive strategy ensures that the system maintains democratic legitimacy while providing valuable assistance to citizens navigating complex budgetary decisions.

Privacy protection extends beyond technical measures to encompass institutional safeguards and community oversight mechanisms. The system design prioritises citizen agency and informed consent, ensuring that users understand both the capabilities and limitations of AI assistance in civic contexts.

Transparency requirements include explainable AI techniques that enable citizens to understand and contest algorithmic outputs. The system provides detailed explanations for moral classifications and recommendation rankings, supporting democratic accountability and enabling informed decision-making.

Accountability mechanisms incorporate audit trails, community oversight, and regular evaluation procedures that assess both technical performance and democratic impact. These mechanisms ensure that the system continues to serve democratic objectives while adapting to changing community needs and values.

\subsection{Bias Mitigation Strategies}

Bias mitigation represents a critical challenge in AI-assisted democratic processes, where systematic unfairness can undermine the inclusive aspirations of participatory budgeting. The system employs a comprehensive multi-layered approach to identify, measure, and address potential biases across different dimensions of the recommendation process.

Training data bias is addressed through sophisticated dataset auditing and augmentation procedures that explicitly incorporate demographic diversity and ensure representation of minority moral perspectives. The synthetic data generation process employs stratified sampling techniques that balance representation across different demographic groups, political orientations, and cultural contexts. This approach ensures that the system can serve diverse communities without privileging dominant perspectives.

The augmentation strategy includes template-based generation that captures common expressions of each moral foundation across different linguistic and cultural contexts. Paraphrasing techniques expand linguistic diversity while maintaining semantic coherence, and cross-domain adaptation leverages existing moral reasoning datasets to improve generalisation across diverse democratic contexts.

Algorithmic bias mitigation employs fairness constraints throughout the model training and evaluation pipeline. The moral classification module implements balanced sampling techniques that ensure equal representation of all moral foundations during training, preventing dominant perspectives from overwhelming minority viewpoints. The recommendation algorithms incorporate diversity constraints that prevent over-concentration of suggestions in specific proposal categories or moral foundations.

The bias detection framework implements multiple metrics including demographic parity measures, equalised odds assessments, and calibration analysis to ensure that system performance remains consistent across different user populations. These metrics are calculated for each component of the system, enabling targeted interventions when bias is detected and supporting continuous improvement of fairness measures.

Interpretability requirements ensure that users can understand and contest algorithmic outputs through comprehensive explanation mechanisms. The system provides detailed explanations for moral classifications and recommendation rankings, enabling citizens to evaluate whether the AI's reasoning aligns with their own moral perspectives. This transparency supports democratic accountability by allowing users to identify and challenge potential biases in system outputs.

The bias mitigation approach extends beyond technical measures to include community engagement and participatory design principles. Regular evaluation procedures assess whether the system continues to meet fairness standards across diverse user populations, and community feedback mechanisms enable ongoing refinement of bias detection and mitigation strategies.

\subsection{Data Privacy and Scope of Human Involvement}

Privacy protection is fundamental to maintaining citizen trust in AI-assisted democratic processes. The system implements a comprehensive privacy-by-design approach that ensures citizen privacy is protected throughout all phases of development, evaluation, and potential deployment.

Data minimisation principles guide all data collection and processing activities, ensuring that only necessary information is collected and processed. The system exclusively uses publicly available datasets such as Pabulib \cite{stolicki_pabulib_2020} and synthetic data generated specifically for research purposes. No real user interactions are processed during development or evaluation phases, completely eliminating risks of privacy breaches or unauthorised data collection.

The privacy framework implements multiple layers of protection including data anonymisation, secure processing environments, and comprehensive audit trails. Personal identifiers are systematically removed or replaced with synthetic alternatives, ensuring that individual citizens cannot be identified through system outputs or research publications. Data retention policies specify strict limits on storage duration and mandate secure deletion procedures for all temporary data.

Anonymisation procedures employ advanced techniques including differential privacy mechanisms and synthetic data generation that preserve statistical properties while protecting individual privacy. The system design incorporates privacy-preserving machine learning techniques that enable model training and evaluation without exposing sensitive information.

Human oversight is embedded throughout the system design to ensure that AI functions as an assistive tool rather than an autonomous decision-maker. The conversational agent provides recommendations and explanations but explicitly frames these as suggestions that citizens should evaluate independently. This human-centred approach maintains citizen agency while leveraging AI capabilities to improve accessibility and engagement.

The oversight framework includes multiple levels of human involvement: individual user control over AI assistance, community-level governance of system deployment, and institutional oversight of ethical compliance. This multi-layered approach ensures that human judgment remains central to democratic decision-making while benefiting from AI capabilities.

Transparency requirements ensure that citizens understand the system's capabilities, limitations, and decision-making processes. Comprehensive documentation explains how moral classifications are generated, how recommendations are ranked, and what data sources inform system outputs. This transparency supports informed consent and enables citizens to make educated decisions about whether to engage with AI-assisted tools.

The transparency framework includes explainable AI techniques that provide detailed explanations for algorithmic outputs, enabling citizens to understand and contest system recommendations. Regular disclosure of system performance metrics and bias detection results ensures ongoing accountability and community trust.

Accountability mechanisms include comprehensive audit trails that log system decisions and enable retrospective analysis of recommendation patterns. These mechanisms support oversight by community representatives and enable identification of potential issues or biases that may emerge during system operation. Regular evaluation procedures assess whether the system continues to meet ethical standards and democratic objectives.

The accountability framework incorporates community feedback mechanisms that enable ongoing refinement of system performance and ethical compliance. Regular community consultations ensure that the system continues to serve democratic objectives while adapting to changing community needs and values.

The scope of human involvement extends beyond individual user interactions to include community-level oversight and governance. The system is designed to support rather than replace deliberative processes, ensuring that AI recommendations contribute to rather than substitute for human judgment and collective decision-making. This approach maintains the democratic character of participatory budgeting while leveraging AI capabilities to address participation barriers and improve civic engagement.

\chapter{Results and Evaluation}

\section{Project Suggestion Accuracy Testing Framework}

To systematically evaluate the quality of project suggestions generated by our conversational agent, we developed a comprehensive testing framework that measures how well the agent suggests relevant projects for given user prompts. This framework provides quantitative metrics to assess the agent's performance and identify areas for improvement.

\subsection{Testing Methodology}

Our testing framework consists of several key components: test case definition with user prompts and expected project categories, metrics calculation including precision, recall, F1 score, ranking accuracy, and top-K accuracy, category matching analysis to evaluate whether suggested projects match expected categories, and automated testing scripts to run tests, generate reports, and analyze results.

\label{fig:testing_framework}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Test Case Structure}

Each test case is defined with the following structure:

\begin{verbatim}
{
  "test_id": "education_001",
  "prompt": "I care about education and helping children learn...",
  "expected_project_ids": ["1", "14", "23", "33", "44"],
  "description": "Education-focused prompt expecting education projects",
  "category": "education",
  "expected_count": 5
}
\end{verbatim}

We created 8 comprehensive test cases covering different categories: education queries, environmental protection queries, health and wellness queries, mixed category queries (education + environment), community and culture queries, safety and security queries, transportation and transit queries, and recreation and sports queries.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}

Our framework calculates several key metrics to assess suggestion quality:

\subsubsection{Precision}
Measures the proportion of suggested projects that were in the expected set:
\begin{equation}
\text{Precision} = \frac{|\text{Expected} \cap \text{Suggested}|}{|\text{Suggested}|}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Recall}
Measures the proportion of expected projects that were suggested:
\begin{equation}
\text{Recall} = \frac{|\text{Expected} \cap \text{Suggested}|}{|\text{Expected}|}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{F1 Score}
Harmonic mean of precision and recall:
\begin{equation}
\text{F1} = \frac{2 \times \text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Ranking Accuracy}
Measures how well the order of suggestions matches expectations, accounting for the position of relevant projects in the ranked list.

\subsubsection{Top-K Accuracy}
For each k (1, 2, 3, etc.), measures what percentage of expected projects appear in the top-k suggestions.

\section{Test Results and Performance Analysis}

Our comprehensive testing revealed significant insights about the agent's performance across different categories and scenarios.

\label{fig:category_matching}
\end{figure}

\section{Algorithm Improvements and Optimization}

The testing framework identified several areas where the recommendation algorithm could be enhanced to improve suggestion quality and accuracy.

\subsection{Enhanced Keyword Matching}

We significantly expanded and refined the keyword dictionaries for each category to improve specificity and reduce cross-category confusion. The improvements included adding specific terms for health keywords such as 'vaccination', 'clinic', 'hospital', 'doctor', 'nurse', 'therapy', 'treatment', 'medicine', 'preventive care', 'nutrition', and 'diet'. Environment keywords were better separated between environmental protection and public health and safety, with specific terms for each domain. Culture keywords were enhanced with terms like 'arts', 'heritage', 'tradition', 'creative', 'art', 'music', 'festival', 'performance', 'theater', 'museum', 'gallery', and 'artist'. Recreation keywords were expanded to include 'sports', 'athletics', 'fitness', 'exercise', 'training', 'competition', 'team', 'league', 'field', 'court', and 'equipment'.

\caption{Process diagram showing the keyword improvement methodology and its impact on category matching accuracy.}
\label{fig:keyword_improvement}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Improved Scoring Algorithm}

The scoring algorithm was enhanced to provide higher weights to exact category matches and reduce cross-category confusion. The improvements included increasing the category bonus multiplier from 2.5x to 3.5x for stronger category matching, adding keyword match bonus with additional scoring for projects that contain specific keywords in their names or descriptions, and refining category separation to better distinguish between similar categories such as Health versus Environment, public health and safety.

Safety & 0.600 & 0.571 & -5\% & Fair \\
Transit & 0.400 & 1.000 & +150\% & Perfect \\
Recreation & 0.000 & 0.571 & +∞ & Fair \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Category Performance Before and After Improvements}
\label{tab:improvement_results}
\end{table}

\subsection{Category Matching Accuracy}

The category matching analysis demonstrated substantial improvements, with average category match accuracy improving from 70.0\% to 100.0\%, representing a 42.9\% increase. Perfect categories now include Education (100\%), Environment (100\%), Mixed (100\%), Community (100\%), and Transit (100\%). High performance categories include Health (60\%) and Safety (40\%), while Recreation (40\%) shows room for further improvement.

\section{Key Insights and Lessons Learned}

\subsection{Testing Framework Value}

The systematic testing framework proved invaluable for identifying specific performance issues, quantifying improvements objectively, providing actionable insights for enhancement, and enabling iterative improvement cycles. The framework's ability to measure both exact project matching and category-based matching provided comprehensive insights into the agent's performance.

\subsection{Category-Specific Challenges}

Different categories presented unique challenges that required tailored approaches. Education already performed excellently due to clear keyword boundaries, while Environment improved significantly with better keyword separation. Community and Culture categories dramatically improved with refined keyword definitions, and Health remained challenging due to overlap with environmental health concepts.

\subsection{Moral Foundations Integration}

The Moral Foundations Theory integration worked well for detecting dominant moral values in user input, providing context for project scoring, and enabling nuanced understanding of user preferences. However, some categories still required additional keyword-based refinement to achieve optimal performance, demonstrating the complementary nature of moral foundations analysis and keyword-based matching.

\section{Future Testing and Evaluation}

\subsection{Expanded Test Suite}

Future work should include more diverse test cases covering edge cases, multi-language support testing, ambiguous query handling, and cross-category query testing. The current framework provides a solid foundation for these extensions.

\subsection{Human Evaluation}

While automated testing provides valuable metrics, human evaluation should complement these results through user satisfaction surveys, relevance assessment by domain experts, A/B testing with real users, and qualitative feedback analysis.

\subsection{Continuous Improvement}

The testing framework enables continuous monitoring of suggestion quality, automated regression testing, performance benchmarking, and iterative algorithm refinement, providing a robust foundation for ongoing system improvement.
